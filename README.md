# Halcyon

Halcyon is a mix between a library website and social media platform (very much in progress) with the goal of incentivizing users to read more. This is done by:

- Suggesting books to users based on their interests
- Allowing users to start a discussion post upon finishing a book
- Allowing users to connect with like-minded people based on their bookshelves
- Allowing users to set reading goals, tracked on a timeline

I've always loved reading, and could see myself using Halcyon, which is the main reason I chose to develop it. I also wish to learn more frontend/backend skills, and making a CRUD application stood out to me as a great way to do so.
